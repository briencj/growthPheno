Description: Assists in producing longitudinal or profile plots of measured 
    traits. These allow checks to be made for anomalous data and growth patterns 
    in the data to be explored. Smoothing of growth trends for individual plants 
    using smoothing splines is available for removing transient effects. There 
    are tools for diagnosing the adequacy of trait smoothing, either using this 
    package or other packages, such as those that fit nonlinear growth models. 
    A range of per-unit (pot, plant, plot) growth traits can be extracted from 
    longitudinal data, including single time-point smoothed trait values and 
    their growth rates, interval growth rates and other growth statistics, such 
    as maximum growth. The package is particularly suited to preparing data from 
    high-throughput phenotyping facilities, such as imaging data from a Lemna-Tec Scananalyzer 3D 
    (see <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRAF_mAEa7E/> for more 
    information). The package 'growthPheno' can also be installed from

`growthPheno` is an R package that collects together functions that can be used to perform functional analyses of phenotypic growth data to smooth and extract traits, as described by Brien et al. (2020). Many of the functions can be applied to longitudinal data in general.

An overview can be obtained using `?growthPheno`. . 

## More information

Two vignettes, `Tomato` and `Rice`, illustrate the process for smoothing and extraction of traits (SET), the former being the example presented in Brien et al. (2020). Use `vignette("Tomato", package = "growthPheno")` or `vignette("Rice", package = "growthPheno")` to access either of the vignettes.

## Installing the package

### From a repository using `drat`

Windows binaries and source tarballs of the latest version of `growthPheno` are available for installation from my [repository](http://chris.brien.name/rpackages). Installation instructions are available there.

### Directly from  GitHub

`growthPheno` is an R package available on GitHub, so it can be installed from the RStudio console or an R command line session using the `devtools` command `install_github`. First, make sure `devtools` is installed, which, if you do not have it, can be done as follows:

`install.packages("devtools")`

Next, install `growthPheno` from GitHub by entering:

`devtools::install_github("briencj/growthPheno")`.

The version of the package on CRAN (see CRAN badge above) and its dependencies can be installed using:

`install.packages("growthPheno")`


If you have not previously installed `growthPheno` then you may need to install it dependencies:

`install.packages(c("dae","GGally","ggplot2","grDevices","Hmisc","JOPS","methods","RColorBrewer","readxl","reshape","stringi"))`

## What is does

This package can be used to perform a functional analysis of growth data using splines to smooth the trend of individual plant traces over time and then to extract traits for further analysis. This process is called smoothing and extraction of traits (SET) by Brien et al. (2020), who detail the use of `growthPheno` for carrying out the method. However, `growthPheno` now has the two wrapper, or primary, functions `traitSmooth` and  `traitExtractFeatures` that implement the SET approach. These may be the only functions that are used in that the complete SET process can be carried out using only them. The `Tomato` vignette illustrates their use for the example presented in Brien et al. (2020). 

The function `traitSmooth` utilizes the secondary functions `probeSmooths`, `plotSmoothsComparison` and `plotSmoothsMedianDevns` and accepts the arguments of the secondary functions. The function `probeSmooths` utilizes the tertiary functions `byIndv4Times_SplinesGRs` and `byIndv4Times_GRsDiff`, which in turn call the function `smoothSpline`. The function `plotSmoothsComparison` calls `plotDeviationsBoxes`. All of these functions play a role in choosing the smoothing method and parameters. 

The primary function `traitExtractFeatures` uses the secondary functions `getTimesSubset` and the set of `byIndv4Intvl_` functions. These functions are concerned with the extraction of traits that have a single value for each individual in the data. 

Data suitable for use with this package consists of columns of data obtained from a set of individuals (e.g. plants, pots, carts, plots or units) over time. There should be a unique identifier for each individual and a time variable, such as Days after Planting (DAP),  that contain no repeats for an individual. The combination of the identifier and a time for an individual should be unique to that individual. For imaging data, the individuals may be arranged in a grid of Lanes $\times$ Positions. That is, the minimum set of columns is an individuals, a times and one or more primary trait columns.

The full set of functions falls into the following natural groupings: 

(i) Wrapper functions

(ii) Data 

(iii) Plots

(iv) Smoothing and calculation of growth rates and water use traits for each individual

(v) Data frame manipulation

(vi) General calculations 

(vii) Principal variates analysis (PVA)
